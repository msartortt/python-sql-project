SQL Project
You were hired by Ironhack to perform an Analytics Consulting Project entitled: competitive landscape.

Your mission is to create and populate an appropriate database with many coding schools that are our competition, as well as design an suitable queries that answer business questions of interest (to be defined by you)

Suggested Steps in the Project:

Read this notebook and understand each function. Comment the code appropriately

Populate the list of schools with a wider variety of schools (how are you going to get the school ID?)

Take a look at the obtained dataframes. What dimensions do you have? what keys do you have? how could the different dataframes be connected?

Go back to the drawing board and try to create an entity relationship diagram for tables available

Once you have the schemas you want, you will need to:

create the suitable SQL queries to create the tables and populate them
run these queries using the appropriate Python connectors
Bonus: How will this datamodel be updated in the future? Please write auxiliary functions that test the database for data quality issues. For example: how could you make sure you only include the most recent comments when you re-run the script?

Suggested Deliverables
5-6 minute presentation of data model created, decision process and business analysis proposed

exported .sql file with the final schema

Supporting python files used to generate all logic

High level documentation explaining tables designed and focusing on update methods
